##Description

This is Snake, the Nokia game we all love and which I spent many hours playing on my first mobile phone. It was my first experience of developing a game and I fell in love with it. It amazes me how code can give us such a rich experience, learning my first steps in Javascript, Html and Css.

##Instructions

If you clone this project, you will need

1 - VsCode with live server extension.

2 - Go live 

3 - Move the snake with the arrow keys. (As soon as you press a key, the game starts!)

4 - If you lose, click Ok to restart. 

##Features

If you're feeling nostalgic and want to go back in time and play the beloved game of Snake, you can play for as many hours as you like! 

##Visuals

To help you better understand the flow and functionality of Flicks, I have included a package of screenshots and a video. These visuals will give you an insight into the application's interface and guide you through its features.

##ROADMAP

It would be cool to add a scoreboard and high scores to the game. I will add such features in the next available version.

##Contributing

Please feel free to send me your ideas or suggestions, feedback or feature requests or improvements, I would love to hear from you! 

##Licence

Flicks is released under the MIT licence.
